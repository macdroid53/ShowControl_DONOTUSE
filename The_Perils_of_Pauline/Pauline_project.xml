  <!-- This is the project file.  Other XML files used by the
       show_control application are equipment, cues, characters, crew,

    <!-- XML format lets us add more values without impacting old readers.
	 However, if we need to make an incompatible change to an old
	 value, having the version number lets us give a good error message
	 if an old program tries to read a newer, incompatible, file.
	 Every reader must check the version number and reject versions
	 it does not know how to read.  The first part of the number is
	 incremented on an incompatible change, the second part on a compatible
	 change: one that adds a value that can be ignored by old readers,
	 for example.  When reading, a program will check the first part of
	 the number and adapt its reading to the indicated format.
	 When writing, a program will use the oldest format capable of
	 expressing the information correctly.  The first version of the
	 show_control programs will reject version numbers in which the value
	 before the decimal point is not equal to 1.  -->

    <!-- The light board, sound mixer, etc, used at the Amato Theater.
	 This information is independent of the production.  This file
	 includes the IP address and port number used to communicate
	 from the sequencer to the sound effects player, the light
	 board controller and the microphone handler.  -->
    <equipment href="Amato_equipment.xml"/>

    <!-- Extra equipment brought in for this production.  The information
	 in this file is used the same way as the standard equipment file,
	 but is kept separate so the standard equipment file does not
	 have to be edited for each production.  This file includes references
	 to the sound effects and sequence used by the sound effects player.

    <!-- The way a cue is executed is specific to the script and the
	 capabilities of the theater.  Every cue has a name.  The script
	 specifies when during the performance each named cue is to be
	 performed.  These files describe, for each named cue, what command
	 or commands to send to the light board, sound effects player and/or
	 microphone handler when the script calls for the cue to be executed.
	 Cues which will be used in many shows are in Amato_cues.xml, whereas
	 cues that are specific to The Perils of Pauline are in
	 Pauline_cues.xml.  -->

    <!-- These are the characters in this production, with the names of their
